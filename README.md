# Console-ATM-python
Console ATM application with python
1. If using pycharm to run the program, please configure your interpreter, you may use system interpreter python 3 and above (3.10 is being used).
2. To run the application on windows with python already installed run or double click the “Assign1” python file.
3. ‘mylib’ is just a function library that I created to improve the coding efficiency.
4. Data is deleted when the application is exited as per requirements.
5. The following link leads to a video describing the
application’s execution. https://youtu.be/4_udOBlIbPQ
6. Thank you.
